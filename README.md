# Classic Multi Independent Variable problem

## Steps I followed :
- Used scatter() from matplotlib to see the nature of data
- Then used Multiple Linear Regression Model using Scikit learn lib
- Finally Checked the predictor values by plotting graphs

#### Assumptions of a Linear Regression :
- Linear
- Homoscedasticity ( In statistics, a sequence or a vector of random variables is homoscedastic if all random variables in the sequence or vector have the same finite variance. )
- Multivariate Normality
- Independence of Error
- Lack of Multicollinearity


Mathematical Model :

<b> y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ...... <b>


# And here I was careful about <i>Dummy Trap<i>
